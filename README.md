<center><h2>Extendable, lean and fast file matching</h2></center>

`Hexid`, pronounced ``[hɛks aɪ-di] (Hex-I-D)``, is a file matching tool designed to find files without the need for a extension. It's designed with extendability in mind and uses a plugin based system, allowing for any type of file to be checked!

`Hexid` was originally named so because it used Hex magic numbers to identify file types, however now it does much more and plugins can run any python code to identify a file.
